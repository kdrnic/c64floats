# c64floats
C++ Commodore 64 floating point library
[Explained here](https://kdrnic.github.io/index_c64floats.html)

Note that rom_basic.cpp and rom_kernal.cpp were redacted for copyright reasons.
If you want to run this for whatever reasons, you have to somehow insert C64 ROM contents into the two arrays there. Where you get those from, is not my business.
